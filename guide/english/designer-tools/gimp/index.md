## GIMP - GNU Image Manipulation Program

GIMP is an open-source image editor. It is free to download and use.

While different, GIMP offers many of the same or similar tools to Adobe Photoshop. 

### Why GIMP?

* Free, open-source software
* Sophisticated tools and functions
* Cross platform - works with Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and more
* Supports multiple programming languages
* Create high quality images
* Reads and exports to multiple file formats
* Customizable interface with many options
* Ability to modify, enhance, and contribute additional tools to the open-source software

It is worth noting that GIMP may be more challenging for beginners. Those who have used Adobe Photoshop may find this app easier to use.
